#DataViva ETL

Extract / Transform / Load Scripts  for databases used in [Dataviva Project](http://www.dataviva.info).

The sources of Dataviva can be found at [Dataviva GitHub](https://github.com/alexandersimoes/dataviva).

#How it Works

Databases are released by Brazil government as raw data and there is some analysis to extract the information needed for the project.

For each database we have a Wiki documentation that exaplain all the ETL process.

We used Qlikview as a BI tool to make this process and the folder has:


1.	QVS
	
	Qliview Scripts, that has the ETL process itself 

2.	Qlikview (QVW)

    Helps to check data using dashboards and can run the QVS
